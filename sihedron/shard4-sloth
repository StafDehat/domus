Description
The Shard of Sloth is made of blue-green glowing abysium. As long as the Shard of Sloth is carried, its owner can use summon monster III as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus conjuration spells, and gains a +4 insight bonus on all concentration and caster level checks.

Curse: The owner becomes lazy and sedentary, and becomes sickened for 1 hour whenever he makes more than a single move action in any round. All of the owner’s movement speeds are halved.
