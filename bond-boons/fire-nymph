FireResist 5

Fiery Mantle (Sp)
As "Fire Shield (warm)"
Casting Time 1 standard action
Duration 1 round/level (D)
This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee.
The flames also protect you from cold-based attacks.  You take only half damage from cold-based attacks.
  If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.
Any creature striking you with its body or a hand-held weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time
  the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per your level (maximum +15).
This damage is fire damage.
If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.
Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
When using this ability, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy,
  increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light.
