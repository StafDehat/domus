Bear Mountain:
Roshar Bridge 4 + Night's Watch + LotR Moria
Names: http://www.firstnamesgermany.com/common-german-names/
Brunhilde arrested, kinda.
When she bailed, relations between the Bearbeard & Stonebore clans got rough.
Brunhilde won't be allowed to leave - fulfill the contract or accept penalties.
Bearbeard are basically commerce & defense of Bear Mountain.
Stonebore set tax rates on output & tunnel use.
There was arguing/fighting, but they settled, and the Brunhilde/Guldus marriage was to solidify the treaty.
When Brunhilde bailed, Stonebore took offense, jacked taxes, and striked digging tunnels for Bearbeards.
Bearbeards are basically not allowed inside the mountain now.
Stonebore spreading disinformation.  Jacking prices and blaming Bearbeards.
Brunhilde can agree to marry Guldus, or be sent to the ShadowWall (ie: Bridge 4).
Bearbeards (1) starting to run a bit short on weaponry.  About to attack Stonebore.
Stonebore (2) digging an alternate route to bypass Bearbeard entirely.  
Steelcaster (3) are having trouble getting materials for manufacturing.  Forced to use metal & stone for more things.
Loadlifter (4) running short on functional tools.  Wooden handles hard to come by.  Metal handles starting, but hurt, and scarce.
Shadowwall (5) are poorly supplied (food/torches/clothes/straps), so have been losing ground to the Duergar.
Shadowwall (5) have lore about the Shard.  It was sealed in a vault long ago, and that territory has been lost to the Underdark (we dug too deep).


SIMPL giants:
Small mountains NE of Gnome's house contain caverns, contains a large deposit of SIMPL.
Problem: It's home to a population of giants.
They used to build & live in great towers.
They undertook the Great Work, a massive tower to reach the heavens and meet their god Pazuzu.
Their pride was punished, fire rained from the sky, driving the giants underground.
The god Kostchtchie (KOSH-chuh-chai) offered them sanctuary within the earth, he's the new god now.
Giants know of the SIMPL, but they guard it, because it is Pazuzu's.
They'll guard it to protect themselves frmo Pazuzu's wrath.
Get it.

Plot-points:
Non-Fatagrin religions have been driven out of Rulon.
Rulon locals are having a rough time of it - overtaxed, men conscripted, bandit raids.
Rulon locals blame Duvia for their trouble, due to Rulon propaganda.
Rask is drumming up aggression for Duvia, and support for his war against 'em.

Trepp can tell them:
Hometown was raided when he was young, he was captured & sold to slavers.
Slavers sold him to Duke Edmund Bearoak of Gibia, and he trained & performed as a court bard for awhile.
Bearoak was okay.  He permitted vacations and such, trusting they'd return because of the slave collar.
Seek new info, tell new stories, etc.
Bearoak got a new advisor who disapproved of the court bards, and Trepp was sold back to slavers.
Purchased by Mormus, who is just awful.
Brutal to him, sends him into dangerous positions, forces him to do morally bankrupt stuff, drills him for information.
