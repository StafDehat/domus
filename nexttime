Get an AntiParty lineup.

AntiParty has been proselytizing Fatagris, and it's taken hold as a major religion in Rulon.

Ahab Reed recognizes the AntiParty as the religious bros, and gives some background info about the religion.

Does Jondi know Infernal?  If so, he can read the Cryptex.  Not that it helps.

Does Isaac want to play Trepp?

Write the assassination note.

Write the flashback.  Do it as a series of visions, each one ending with the death of "self", including:
-Mechanics: As "Vision" (https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/vision/)
-Witnessing Fatagris arrival.  Quiet mountain town, fireball from sky, investigate & it's Fatagris - it kills you.

-Fatagris makes the mountains volcanic, eruption kills you & your town.
  Sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjTF3zxtJ3I
-Cult of Fatagris is burning you on a stake, "purifying the heretics".  Your fellow burnees are shouting that The Warming will kill everyone, the cult insists Fatagris will protect the righteous.

-You are wielding the Sihedron during "Elemental War" to attack Fatagris.

  You: http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/npc-s/npc-20/elicia-stormraven/
  It makes you a Level 20 Paladin, plus some bonuses or something.  You find the heat-pump, pulling magma to the surface, you destroy it, then your buddy kills you, apologizing, but no one should have that much power.
-You're holding an onyx spike & alabaster hammer, spike positioned over the center of sihedron, on Anvil of Fury.  There are 14 people around you.
  A man with you offers to break it for you, and you can scatter the pieces instead.  Someone swings, sihedron shatters.
  If you, you die.  If friend, you carry 1x shard, 13 people take the other 6x shards and 7x stones.  You are ambushed & killed on your way out.
