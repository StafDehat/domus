Lukas talks to the lady.

A Mage's servant asks for Jondi - that plane-sensitive dude is willing to see him, and is having a good day.

  Use bull rush as possible to grant AoO to allies.
  If able to close with caster, keep pressure with Step Up, and try to interrupt casting.

Gnome uses Ghost Sound & Dancing Lights to lead 'em into an alley where he's prep'd a trap:

Sounds like some metal clanging/fighting, a couple screams, and some shouts for help:
  "Fetch the guards!  We'll hold 'em off until you find help!"
DC30 (or highest) Perception to hear it.  DC12 Will save to disbelieve it.
DC20 Perception to see the trap, DC20 to disarm.
 -Brunhilde gets an attempt to notice the stone-based trap.
While attempting to disarm, arrow attack from:

Perception vs Stealth+15 to notice assassin - failure = FlatFooted.
Assassin attacks with +1 hand crossbow +8 (1d4+1/19â€“20), Plus Cloudthorn Venom
  https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/cloudthorn-venom/
  Save Fortitude DC 14; Onset 1d4 rounds; Frequency 1/hour for 3 hours.
  Effect 1d3 Str and Dex damage, and feel-no-pain for 1 hour.  Perception rolls to notice damage.
