Plot-points:
Non-Fatagrin religions have been driven out of Rulon.
Rulon locals are having a rough time of it - overtaxed, men conscripted, bandit raids.
Rulon locals blame Duvia for their trouble, due to Rulon propaganda.
Rask is drumming up aggression for Duvia, and support for his war against 'em.

Trepp can tell them:
Hometown was raided when he was young, he was captured & sold to slavers.
Slavers sold him to Duke Edmund Bearoak of Gibia, and he trained & performed as a court bard for awhile.
Bearoak was okay.  He permitted vacations and such, trusting they'd return because of the slave collar.
Seek new info, tell new stories, etc.
Bearoak got a new advisor who disapproved of the court bards, and Trepp was sold back to slavers.
Purchased by Mormus, who is just awful.
Brutal to him, sends him into dangerous positions, forces him to do morally bankrupt stuff, drills him for information.

Trepp's suffering from a disease, Red Breath:
