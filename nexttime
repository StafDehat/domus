Foraging party from Krusk's army is sheltering in an abandoned home, having been attacked by fire critters.

Krusk is laying seige to a temple of Irori, which is defended by clerics/warpriests/monks/paladins/etc.
Clerics are summoning food & water to sustain.
Krusk wants the Guiding Hand seeds to find out if his parents are alive, and if they care about him.

Guiding Hand:
  A flower, like a lily, with 5x white petals that fade to a deep blue in the center where the pistil is.
  The plant flowers annually, and each flower contains a single seed.
  When cultivated with holy water blessed by a priest of Irori, that seed can be used for foretelling.
  When burnt, the seed smolders, emitting a heavy smoke - white=positive, black=negative response.  ie: Yes/No


Entrance to temple possible through catacombs?
Gareth knows of a secret route through the catacombs, and asks for Dakath's help in sneaking in & killing/poisoning/etc.
Krusk has hired Gareth to break the walls.

The clerics tattoo their offhand blue, which becomes their holy symbol.
Krusk has a dessicated blue hand on display, and/or around his neck?
