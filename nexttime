Ahab is happy to investigate the Half-Orc warlord, but doesn't know anything right now.
He's got his anti-party line-up ready though, and in the meantime maybe you could solve an assassination plot?


If you can identify 'em:
AntiParty has been proselytizing Fatagris, and it's taken hold as a major religion in Rulon.
Ahab Reed recognizes the AntiParty as the religious bros, and gives some background info about the religion.
They call themselves "miesalmebi" (მიესალმები), which loosely translated to common, means something like "The Welcome Party".
Been around forever, but popularity ebbs & flows.
They think their god is sleeping within a volcano, and when he wakes will cleanse the world in purifying fire, sparing only followers, and bestow gifts of power.

If you can't?
To identify - Wisdom check? A hint every 5?

Goals:
Some higher-up rando from Rulon hired Vyndra Kalador to weaken Duvia.
Turns out that second-in-command is prep'd to inherit the Marshall position.
2nd totally works for Rulon



Prep the music for scenes where they open the Cryptex.


Roy's starting a wizard school.  Work on drawing up a contract for that?
