As dusk falls in camp, it grows cold rapidly, and starts snowing.

You feel a chill as the temperature drops sharply.
The wind picks up, and you notice flecks of white streaking in the wind.
Brunhilde might remember this as snow.

A tall figure appears from the shadows, wearing a hooded red robe.
The robe looks to have once been quite elegant, made of fur and trimmed in white.
It's lost most of the insulation it once had, and is threadbare in places.
The white trim has grown quite dingy, and dark stains pepper the robe,
  as if the wearer had been labouring in a blacksmith forge.

The tree limbs overhead seem to lean toward the figure as it moves through the woods, casting it in perpetual shadow.

Little can be seen of the creature itself.
The robes seem to hang loosely over a hunched, bony frame.
It walks with a strange gait, bobbing with each step,
  its knees seeming to bend in the wrong direction.
From its sleeves emerge dark-skinned, bony hands with long fingers and nails.
The arms are poised somewhat awkwardly forward, as if the creature were hesitantly reaching to examine something.
The face is obscured by the robe's hood, but a long, dirty-gray beard spills out,
  and two curved horns pierce the top of the hood.
Bits of sticks and leaves cling to its robes and beard.

Two baleful embers glow from beneath the hood as it lays eyes upon your party.
Roll for initiative.

Goals:
Kill Esmeralda?
Throw Keeran into the sack.
Run away.

You hear twigs snap and leaves rustling.
It sounds like a large creature is crashing through the undergrowth toward you.

A rather tall (for a dwarf), portly dwarf bursts into full view,
  making a grand entrance as he stops in a moonlit clearing,
  the reflected silvery light making him seem to glow.
He's wearing vibrant red fur robes, almost a newer version of the beaten-up robes worn by that last creature.
On his windburned face, the man sports a grand, white beard that any dwarf would be proud of.
His belt is made from shiny black leather, bearing a fancy silver buckle.
He's wearing thick brown leather gloves and riding boots.
It's incredibly rare to see anyone wearing such fine vestments outside of a major town.
Not only that, it seems foolhardy to ruin such finery on the road,
  and straight-up daft to be wearing such cold-weather garments in late spring.
That being said, you can't help but admire the man as a gust picks up, swirling the falling
  snowflakes in a cyclone around him, his beard and robes fluttering in the wind.
His piercing blue eyes scan the area, apparently searching for something.
As his gaze finds the body of Esmeralda, his gaze softens.

"
My sympathies for your fallen comrade.
Am I right to blame the horned demon for this tragedy?
"
Has it captured any of your party?
"
This demon has long haunted Domus, and through all that time,
I have done what I can to shelter the innocent from its offenses.
I can save the boy, but I'll need your help to rescue him.
"
When night falls, the demon will kindle a flame.
The light will reveal its location, but we must not tarry.
It plans to toss your friend upon the fire.
"
(But he's immune to fire)
What a fascinating child.
True as that may be, the flames are not this creature's only weapon.
Still, it may buy us the time we need.
"

Basic strategy:
Setup a protection-from-evil circle right now, traps & wards maybe too.
Come nightfall, the party heads out to the firelight.
Carry a pearl of Clairvoyance/Clairaudience so Nic Kriss can keep tabs.
  He'll come help if you get into trouble.
Get Keeran, probably with stealth, retreat back to camp.
Nic will RemoveCurse from Keeran, then Keeran can help fight.
If you can hold out 'til morning, you're good.

 On, Vomit! On, Vapid! On, Blunder and Nixon!"
