Goals:
Dwarf Caves
Need to send 'em into the dwarf caves, to wage war against the duergar
Want to send 'em to a lich's castle, who's also an ancestor to the wizard
The Shard of Gluttony basically gives someone the power to be a necromantic warlord, so they'll have to battle that
  https://github.com/StafDehat/domus/blob/master/quests/sihedron/shard2-glutton
And I want 'em to find the Iceborn too, so they can learn about the construct-vs-construct battle
Oh, and they need to actually go into the basement of a Fatagrin temple at some point





As for the AntiParty, They call themselves "miesalmebi" (მიესალმები), which loosely translated to common, means something like "The Welcome Party".
They think their god is sleeping within a volcano, and when he wakes will cleanse the world in purifying fire, sparing only followers, and bestow gifts of power.


Goals:
Some higher-up rando from Rulon hired Vyndra Kalador to weaken Duvia.
Turns out that second-in-command is prep'd to inherit the Marshall position.
2nd is a Fatagrin.
