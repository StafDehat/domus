When they socket Pride/Humility together, holder gets a vision of the closest pair:
 -Shard is held by Krusk the Half-Orc, who's running a lawless band in the Whitewood. (Forest between Duvia & Rulon).
 -Stone is secured on a leather thong, hanging on a sword, stuck in the earth at Dakath's hometown.  Sword belongs to The Knight.  Knight was never actually a good guy - he was influenced by the Stone.




Encounter Trepp, he asks for help?

Get Jondi's school contract figured out.
 -Give him hard requirements for resources and how he can earn 'em
 -
Jondi might talk to the ghost wizard.

Force Lukas to steal the Shard.
As for the AntiParty, They call themselves "miesalmebi" (მიესალმები), which loosely translated to common, means something like "The Welcome Party".
They think their god is sleeping within a volcano, and when he wakes will cleanse the world in purifying fire, sparing only followers, and bestow gifts of power.


Goals:
Some higher-up rando from Rulon hired Vyndra Kalador to weaken Duvia.
Turns out that second-in-command is prep'd to inherit the Marshall position.
2nd is a Fatagrin.


Roy's starting a wizard school.  Work on drawing up a contract for that?

Rando ideas:
