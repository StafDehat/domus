Bear Mountain:
A mountain in Igna(?) about which dwarves reside.
Around the mountain, Living Steel trees grow.
Within the mountain, Celestial Mithral can be mined.
Multiple subterranean levels exist beneath the mountain.
The rich metal resources in & around Bear Mountain make it a prime target for bandit-sorta folk.
The dwarves defend their territory.
A specific breed of particularly-intelligent bear lives on Bear Mountain - the "Anart Uvel", or GentleBear.
 -They have neckbeards and schnauser-like moustache puffs.  The dwarves often style their bears' beards:

 -Name is both fitting & ironic.  These bears possess a sense of honour, though they can be far from gentle.
 -The dwarves have also taken to styling the beards like a Gentleman.


Each subterranean level of Bear Mountain is essentially a large town.
Each needs to consume & produce some stuff.

Mountaintops:
Giants, Orc (Worg Riders, for sure), Hobgoblins?, Goblinoid?

Ground & B1L:
Bearbeard clan.
Many Rangers among the BearBeards.  They're bear-riders.
Many dwarven children are paired with a baby Avar'vel (AnartUvel/GentleBear), who becomes their companion for life.
When the bear dies, the ranger typically retires from Rangering, and starts raising cubs instead.
Those Dwarf/Bear pairs are the primary Terranean defense vs thieves/bandits/etc.
These are the primary liasons to the outside world, too.  Merchants, etc.
Export tools/weapons to Terranean races.
Import food/luxuries/etc & resell to other clans.

B2L:
StoneBore clan.
Primary excavators.  Other clans hire these guys to build stuff out.
Often employed by LoadLifter clan to reach veins of minerals.
Tax movement through tunnels, like a toll road - they built it, after all.
Buy tools for stonecutting, from SteelCasters.

B3L:
SteelCaster clan.
Industrial - these guy smelt ore & forge weapons.
These guys make Fire-Forged steel, among other fancy materials.
Sell weapons to BearBeard & ShadowWall clans.
Sell tools to LoadLifter & StoneBore clans.

B4L:
LoadLifter clan (as in, Loadstone/Ore/Mineral)
The miners.  They employ StoneBore digging teams, but finding/excavating is LoadLifter work.
Tools are bought from SteelCasters.
Ore is sold to SteelCasters.

B5L:
ShadowWall clan.
Hardened warriors, skilled at fighting vs magic.
Also, dwarves committed of crimes and sentenced to exile, have the option to instead serve in defense here.
Defense vs Duergar, mostly.
Criminals are used for cannon-fodder sorta jobs.  Lifelongs have inborn magic resistance.
  -Spell Smasher: Dwarven families who are threatened by hostile magic-users, especially those who face duergar foes, train intently to thwart spellcasting. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against creatures in the process of casting spells or spell-like abilities. This racial trait replaces defensive training and hatred. Source PZO9280
  -Deep Tradition: A dwarf with this racial trait gains a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls and a +1 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity made by drow, duergar, creatures of the aberration type, or creatures of the giant or orc subtype. This replaces defensive training and hatred. PPC:HftF

B6L:
This is basically the top level of Underdark.
Duergar, & hardcore Fatagris.
(Duergar is dwarven for gray-faced)
Drow, duergar, creatures of the aberration type




Brunhilde:
Relations were a bit rocky between StoneBore & BearBeard clans.
 -StoneBore have been pretty aggressive with taxes, both directions.
Born and Raised as a BearBeard, gifted Rock on her 15th birthday (~7yrs for a human)
Trained as border defense (Bear-Back/Bear Rider), but arranged to wed Guldus StoneBore to solidify an alliance.
 -Neither of you is super royal - you're both like, 3rd cousins sorta.  Not much authority.
StoneBores are a fair bit more misogynistic than BearBeards - women aren't allowed to fight or dig.
Brunhilde started training as a Cleric, a task more suited to femininity.
Once the marriage was arranged, Rock was set loose in the woods 'round Bear Mountain.
As a young Anar'vel (Intelligent & Fancy), Rock was captured and sold to a traveling circus as a performer.
Coincidentally, this is the same circus that bought Pipa as a slave.
Misogeny, love for Rock, resistance to arranged marriage, etc all led Brunhilde to bail.
Rock escaped the circus while it was in Duvia, and began roaming.
Brunhilde eventually found Rock in Blackrock (ironically), where they reunited as a BearBack team.
