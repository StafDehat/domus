Yo, does Dakath have a last name?

Hmm.. I don't know it because I was abandoned by my parents as a child
Who/what raised him then?

Angels
And is Dakath even your given name?
Or was he nameless, and just chose to be called Dakath
And if he chose it, does it have any deeper meaning?

The name was chosen because of an adventurers tales about a brave knight with a similar name
The adventurer would come from time to time and tell me about his journeys
Where was this?  Angels are native the outer planes - did they take you out there, or was there a colony hanging out in the material plane?

It was a colony on the material plane
Is it still there?  Do you know where it is/was?

They raised me there so I could have a slightly normal upbringing but upon my 18th birthday when I left home they said they would no longer be on this plain but with me in spirit
Cool, was kinda hoping they'd bailed
Angels hanging out in town would make my story a bit odd

Haha
Why did you become a Paladin?
And/or do you have any personal goals?
ie: Lukas kinda wants to murder the person who killed his family

Being raised by such good creatures and hearing the stories of the brave knight who did many good deeds throughout the world I decided I would do the same and and rid the world of as much evil as I can in my lifetime through the knowledge and strength given to me. I found becoming a paladin would help me achieve this goal.
Any idea what became of this knight?
And FYI, there's a whole slew of Angel races

No in recent years it seems he hasn't been showing up. I have wondered about this and if I can would like to find him
