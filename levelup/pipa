Great rogue talents:
Assault Leader - If you miss while flanking, an ally gets to attack
Peerless Maneuver - For acrobatics, try twice.  Note: Acrobatics allows avoiding AoO.
Canny Observer - +4 perception
Fast Getaway - Withdraw as a move action (ie: 5ft, SnkAtk, Withdraw, repeat next turn)
Hairpin Trick - DisableDevice better
Lasting poison - Poison lasts 2x attacks
Ninja Trick (Deadly Range) - SneakAttack from 15ft.
Ninja Trick (Pressure Points) - SnkAtk does Str or Dex dmg
Ninja Trick (Fatal Finesse) + DEX mod to dmg
Ninja Trick (Master of Shadows) - Give the whole team your stealth
Ninja Trick (Sleep with your eyes open) - No perception penalty when sleeping
Resiliency - Don't die
Sacred Sneak (if good?) - Good-aligned damage from sneaks
Spell Storing - Bank spells, use whenever
Toxic Regurgitation - Spit poison

Strategy: Max your dex, get +atk wherever you can, then flank, 2-hand attack, and sneak attack.

Stats:
Str:  9 -2 = 7  (-2) (Dump)
Dex: 15 +2 = 17 (+3) (Primary)
Con: 14 +0 = 14 (+2) (HP)
Int: 10 +0 = 10 (+0) (Skill points)
Wis: 10 +0 = 10 (+0) (Perception, important  for traps)
Cha: 12 +2 = 14 (+2) (TheFace, plus Underhanded later)
*Pick either Int (for skills) or Wis (for Perception) for an extra 2 points, so +1 mod.

Skills:


Hidden: vs Flat-footed AC
Flanking: +2 atk
vs FlatFeet: +1 atk

Choose one of these two:
1) Craven, Dimdweller, Secretive Survivor
 +1 atk when flanking
 +1 Init
 +2 bluff
 +2 stealth, +4 if dim/dark
 +2 intimidate if dim/dark
 +2 perception if dim/dark
 -4 save vs fear, & no morale bonuses <<Situational anyway
 -1 all saves <<This hurts a little
 -2 acrobatics & climb
2) Skulker, Secretive Survivor
 +1 attack vs no-dex
 +2 bluff
 +2 stealth
 -2 acrobatics & climb
 -2 save vs fear << Situational anyway
Note: Are you going to stealth more, or flank more?
