Who/Where's that knight?

Have an idea where the other stones are, 'cause visions & shit

Figure out who's puppetting Rask.

Lukas was perhaps captured by AntiParty and they grilled him for the Cryptex.
Lukas caught wind of Fatagris and thought that'd be handy.
He's also kind of interested in the Shard of Wrath?
The Mieselmebi let slip a bit of info





What do the Mieselmebi know about Fatagris?
What do they know about Sihedron?
Do they know something Sihedron-related is in the Cryptex?
Why do they want the Cryptex?
  -Maybe they just recognized the runes from some old plaques in their temple.
Lukas is at least intrigued, maybe under duress, who knows.
