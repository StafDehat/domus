SPECIAL ABILITIES

AntiCoagulant (Ex)
The bleeding caused by Fatagris' snake fingers requires a DC25 Heal check (or caster
level check, for magical healing) to stanch.

Construct Mastery (Su)
Fatagris avoids battle, prefering to use servants and constructs.
Ages of practice with artificery has given him an innate understanding of magical
constructs, and he is often able to exploit flaws in others' designs.  With a Will
save vs a Construct's Spell DC, Fatagris can turn a magical construct to his own
purposes, effectively stealing control of the construct, or at least negating
any benefits granted the original user of the construct.  This ability requires that
Fatagris be in physical contact with the Construct, and must make two successful
saves before gaining control of the construct.  Each attempt is a Standard Action.

#Counterport (Su)
#As an immediate action, Barbatos can negate any conjuration (calling, summoning, or teleportation), effect within 30 feet, or redirect creatures to new valid destinations within 30 feet. Affected creatures take 10d6 points of damage, but with a successful DC 35 Fortitude save, a creature takes only half damage and can teleport normally.
#As a standard action, Barbatos can recall one creature that teleported since the end of his last turn. This functions as above, but the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied); the teleported creature can resist being recalled with a successful DC 35 Will save. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Venomous Touch (Ex)
Each of Fatagris' fingers ends in a long snake.  These snakes possess a necrotic venom.
As a full-round action, Fatagris can attack with all 10x of these snakes as natural
weapons, each using his full BAB.  A successful hit deals X damage, and the defender
must succeed at a DC 20+X Fortitude save or contract Deathblade poison.
The save DC increases by X, where X=2*NumberOfSuccessfulBites.
These natural attacks may be divided between targets, but must attack in sets of 5 (one hand per target).

Coercion (Sp)
As a Swift Action, Fatagris may initiate a contest of will with any creature within sight that has
been bonded to a devil via the Fatagrin church baptismal ceremony.  Fatagris makes a Will save to set
the Save DC.  Target creature must succeed at a Will Save vs the Save DC, or fall under control of
Fatagris.
Target may attempt a new Will Save at the end of its turn, and any time it takes damage from a physical
or magical attack (ongoing bleed, poison, etc damage does not grant a new save).
Every failed save reduces the Save DC by 1.
After a successful save, target is immune to Fatagris' Coercion for 24 hours.
# 
# Sphere of Souls (Su)
# As a full-round action, even when he is projecting his consciousness through his likeness or an animal, Barbatos can create a polished black crystal sphere that functions as a crystal ball with detect thoughts, which also grants him the benefits of status for 13 hours on one creature scried by the user. Each round a creature other than Barbatos uses the sphere, it must save against Barbatos’s dominate person ability. Barbatos can freely manipulate the vision the scryer sees, as false vision, and can use detect thoughts and scrying at unlimited range on any creature within 10 feet of the sphere, with no save and with a +10 bonus on caster level checks. Effects that normally block scrying spells instead allow each creature a saving throw and negate the bonus on caster level checks. Barbatos can have up to 13 such spheres at a time, and can destroy a sphere as a free action from any distance.

ECOLOGY

Environment any (Hell)
Organization solitary (unique)
Treasure triple (, other treasure)

Fatagris exists on Golarion in the form of an Archdevil.  In actuality, this Archdevil is the avatar of the God Typhon.
Barbatos is a mystery among the lords of Hell, a being from beyond who came into the service of Asmodeus a mere millennium ago. Technically not a devil, Barbatos is nonetheless the archdevil of the uppermost layer of Hell. Since his arrival, he has served as the doorwarden of Hell, guarding its outer layer from angelic invasions and fiendish forays alike, and dealing with an endless stream of damned souls needing guidance to their final purgatory and tearful petitioners willing to risk everything for one final glimpse of their lost loves.

Barbatos dresses plainly, rarely showing more than his wicked staff and rumpled cloak, and stands 5 feet tall.

Eyjatas (Major Artifact)
Slot none; CL 26th; Weight 4 lbs.; Aura overwhelming all

Barbatos wields a potent weapon named Eyjatas, a +4 speed unholy quarterstaff embedded with innumerable inhuman eyeballs. Three times per day when striking a creature with Eyjatas, its wielder can rip the target’s eyes out, permanently blinding it and dealing 2d6 points of bleed damage. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 30 Fortitude save, but no save is allowed if the attack was a confirmed critical hit. Once Eyjatas rips out a creature’s eyes, it functions as a bane weapon against that target.

Three times per day, the wielder of Eyjatas can cast prying eyes. In addition, the wielder can use arcane eye at will, even on other planes viewed through scrying, and can use eyebite (DC 20) at will within 30 feet of the arcane eye.

DESTRUCTION

To destroy Eyjatas, the quarterstaff’s dozens of eyes must be blinded by the purifying light of an unwavering truth spoken by an immortal that has only ever spoken lies in its life. Once the eyes are blinded in this way, the staff must be hurled into a magical portal that has no entrance and that leads nowhere.

Fatagris’ Cult
Fatagris has grown intimately familiar with the goals
, and is worshiped by those who tread the hidden interstitial spaces of the universe, as well as those who manipulate animals and wild beasts, warping them through foul sorceries into sinister servants. His sacred places are found near crossroads, marketplaces, and ports, some accessible only by teleportation. As befits his role as the guardian to the entrance to Hell (and his association with gateways of all types), entrances to compounds are often held with particular reverence by Barbatos’s cult, and the doorways or arches that provide access to his temples or other sites sacred to him often bear his likeness or symbol.

Fatagris’ unholy symbol is three pairs of wings, one pair oriented upward, one downward, and one to the sides.
His favored weapon is the scorpion whip, and his followers are proficient in its use as both a scorpion whip, and also as a normal whip.
He grants access to the Law, Fire, Artifice, Rune domains and to the Judgement, Trap, Construct, and Wards subdomains.
