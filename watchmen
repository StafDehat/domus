"This sword belonged to Sir Galon Duvee, and it's the one he carried during the assault on the rift 250 years ago.
The valor he displayed during that battle impressed King Rodol Nekha enough to earn him the title of Duke.
From this sword our duchy was born, and with this sword our duchy's defenders are born."

"Now rise, Sir _ _, retainer to the Duchess Heather Blackwell, defender of Duvia and guardian of the Nekha Kingdom."

Next chance we get to chat with Ahab, he'll tell 'em about that Half-Orc
Ahab knows the name Vyndra.  Vyndra Kalador is a Rulon diplomat.
  Lately she's been trying to negotiate the building of Fatagris temples in Duvia's towns.  She's not supposed to be in town right now though.
  Rulon's offered to provide clergy to staff them.
  Ahab still thinks they're a cult and won't allow 'em to build here.  Best they've got is street-corners.
