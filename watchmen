Contact poison?

Where will the adventurers be?  How will they communicate?
Search people upon entering perimeter?
How do the assassins plan to escape afterward?

  "We are here today to honor your efforts as the newest of the city watch.
You have chosen a profession, one of the most dangerous professions of this world.
Whereas others run from danger, you run toward it.  Time and time again.
And for that, we all owe you a huge debt of gratitude, so thank you.
Thank you for protecting our duchess, our families, ourselves, and our precious city.
Now let's get these formalities over with so we can get on with the after-party"

Graduate speech:
It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default. 
Congratulations are in order to my fellow watchmen, for avoiding a cautious failure.
