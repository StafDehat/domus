Party sold a bunch of old stuff, dispersed gold.
Lukas went potion shopping, picked up 8x CLW(5), 1x Ant Haul, 1x Wizened Appearance, 1x Jump, and 1x "Love Potion" (water)
Jondi set to work crafting & identifying.
Pipa, Lukas, Brunhilde, & Rock investigated the Fatagrin Temple.
In the sitting room, Lukas found the older lady he'd abandoned that morning.
Pipa made a friend - a young half-elf, recently turned 16.
Party sat through a sermon, promising salvation from world's end, and ultimately a meritocracy.
Party decided to "join the church" to seek additional information.

Keeran joined first.
A priest brought a small metal box containing a glowing, burning green stone - used it to light a torch.
Torch burned with green flame.
Priest returned stone to the box, and left.
A different priest carried a basket of dirty rags from the downstairs, placed them on the table.
"Joining" involves a priest cutting your arm, bandaging the wound with a clean linen rag,
  then tying your freshly-used bandage to one of the dirty rags, tying both around his staff/spear,
  then holding them in the green flame, where they burn together.
Keeran reported feeling warm, then went into the "Sacred Hall".
