Chase scene - running from Krampus, Cold Rider, & Cryohydra
Longstrider, Haste, etc helped.
Made it back to the copse, which Santa had decorated with tinsel, lights, snow, etc.
Made a stand, fought off Cold Rider & Cryohydra.
Santa transformed everyone into Stegosaurus, and they scared away Krampus.
Brunhilde stole Cold Riders's ice armor (which will melt), and antlers.
Santa gave everyone Christmas presents.
