Party left Braedon, destined for Three Rivers.
Camped in a secluded copse, attacked by Krampus.
Krampus nearly murdered Esmeralda, shoved Keeran into a bag.
Krampus retreated.
Santa showed up, healed 'em, sent 'em to save Keeran.
Party saved Keeran and two other kids, Jane & Felix.
Escaped by climbing out a hole in the cavern roof.
Jane knocked a rock down, and Krampus came at 'em.
