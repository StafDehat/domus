That Half-Orc

Duvia doesn't have a history of employing Half-Orcs, least not what's in charge.
They're known for their ferocity in battle, but not for their restraint.
They can be useful, but they're not well-suited for leadership.
When did you say this happened?
X+2/3 years ago there was a half-orc in our employ.  Named Krusk.
 -Had a series of misconduct charges for brutality.  Local fights, some accusations from local women, etc.
 -Was stationed in Fort Brandt when he deserted.
 -He's probably been living in Rulon since - the penalty for desertion is death, so he wouldn't dare return to Duvia.
 -Could explain how he had access to our uniforms
 -He certainly would not have been acting under Duvia authority, if he was attacking villages.

Devil pact - Fatagris stuff
-Gave him power
