One of my D&D players got married
So he took a few months off D&D
He's coming back tonight
We'll have to level him up
It was the greatsword power-attack fighter
While he was gone we picked up a greatsword power-attack paladin (edited)
I didn't plan that - they just happened to choose the same weapon
Fighter's on a vengeance quest to kill the bro who raped his wife & murdered his wife/daughter
Paladin's an abandoned child, raised in an angel village, trying to reconnect with a knight that used to visit occasionally while the kid was growing up
Paladin became a paladin & adventurer because he looked up to the knight
I think that knight's gonna end up being both the fighter & paladin's father
So fighter & paladin are half-brothers
I had some under-the-table talk with the fighter, too
His backstory = villager/farmer living happily with is wife/daughter.  Conscripted into Rulon army.  While serving, wife & daughter were killed.
He heard about the attack, deserted the Rulon army and headed home
Found corpses, fled to Duvia since he'd deserted Rulon ('cause desertion = death penalty)
Turns out the half-orc that raided his village was wearing Duvia uniform, so now he's all "Wait did my current duchy-of-residence order the murder of my family?"
So this character's on kind of a breaking-bad streak
His life went kinda dark after he got conscripted by Rulon
He frequents the brothels, bars, etc - frequently gets into fights
So when  the player had to take time off for wedding stuff, the party woke up, character was missing, and they found out he'd been drunk-tank'd for barfights
It's been about a week now
He was released after 1-2 days
But, previous adventure in this campaign - while they were in Astabar's manor, someone stole their horses
I kinda expected the party to track 'em, and I was going to introduce primary antagonists
Instead, the group just shrugged, got sad, and moved on
So in town later, while they were doing the "Return to me this bag of gold" quest, the antiparty shows up riding the horses and tries to take the gold
That much was just business, of course - nothing personal
So the group fights off the antiparty, and the antiparty tries to get on the horses & retreat
( These groups have never seen each other before )
Now the players get some good rolls & such, and manage to chase off the antiparty sans-horses
They found the Cryptex in the saddlebags
So now, from the perspective of the antiparty: We were simply trying to make some cash, and these jackwads stole our horses and all our shit

Anders Nelson [11:05 AM]
Well, horses they know they stole...
and money they were trying to steal

Andrew Howard [11:06 AM]
"stole"

Anders Nelson [11:06 AM]
These dudes are clearly not kosher

Andrew Howard [11:06 AM]
They found horses tied to a fence, unfed and unwatered for a couple days
Turns out the antiparty is basically a cult prophet group
They're followers of Fatagris, and they're trying to proselytize their religion
It's already the major religion in Rulon, and they're trying to spread into Duvia

Anders Nelson [11:11 AM]
But don't Rulon and Duvia hate one another?

Andrew Howard [11:11 AM]
Yeah, pretty much
But religion isn't exactly government

Anders Nelson [11:11 AM]
Wouldn't the powers that be in Duvia want to persecute the Rulon religion?

Andrew Howard [11:11 AM]
Yeah Duvia's not thrilled with this
But Duvia's basically the US - they try to be fair about religion & stuff
Ahab, the captain of guard in Blackrock (Duvia capital), won't allow any Fatagris temples in his town
But the prophets still come & go, and shout from street corners & stuff
Anyway, we found the Cryptex in their saddlebags
Turns out the antiparty was carrying that around 'cause the text on it looks familiar to them - it's similar to some ancient writings they have stored in their temples
Same language
They don't speak it though, so they can't outright read it, but they were like "This is probably a relic of our religion.  We should bring this home."
Then the players "stole" it
So the antiparty's been lookin' for these guys, 'cause now it's personal.  So when the fighter was released from prison, the antiparty found & captured him.

Andrew Howard [11:16 AM]
So, no

Anders Nelson [11:16 AM]
He joins anti party?

Andrew Howard [11:17 AM]
Not exactly
He's kinda floating allegiances right now

Anders Nelson [11:17 AM]
I mean party ditched him in drunk tank
and Duvia basically screwed his family
although he can't really go back to Rulon due to going MIA I bet he still feels like it is his home
and he might even follow Fatagris
If that is the prevailing religion from his home land
I guess it depends how your player RPs it

Andrew Howard [11:22 AM]
But, he's not still captured
But he didn't "escape", exactly
Basically he was held for awhile, and they interrogated him to find the cryptex
He basically only knows "My bros took it"
So coercion didn't really work out, and the antiparty has figured out that he's not really strongly-allied to the player group
So they started preaching at him
You know how Christianity is all - accept Jesus, repent for sins, try to live well & for the glory of God, & you get to hang in Heaven when you die and/or when judgement day happens & all the sinners are left behind
Fatagrism essentially has that same deadline sort of thing - also kinda like cthulhu
Fatagris sleeps within a volcano, and one day he'll rise, purifying the world (Domus) with righteous fire, killing the non-believers
The followers of Fatagris (ie: "The Welcome Party") will be granted power and life
So the antiparty starts preaching at this fighter, and they promise him power, they promise him revenge against this half-orc raider, and they hint that their god might be able to bestow the "gift of life" on his dead daughter
All they want is that Cryptex in return
So fighter's starting to think that maybe he should get that cryptex, and the anti-party lets him go
So tonight, Fighter meets up with the party again
Party has some info that the fighter doesn't know, mostly regarding this vengeance quest
Fighter has some info about this antiparty that the party doesn't know
ie: If we go to a Fatagris temple, we might be able to find a book to help us understand this Cryptex thing, and maybe even to open it.
ie: The halfling running with the antiparty (Trepp) is actually wearing a slave collar controlled by the Duergar (Mormus)
Apparently Trepp used to live in Willowbottom, which is the same village our players' halfling (Pipa) is from
Pipa's village was attacked, most killed, some sold into slavery, including Pipa
And apparently, including Trepp
So Trepp is possibly acquainted and/or related to Pipa

Anders Nelson [11:33 AM]
So they have a possible in with the anti party

Andrew Howard [11:33 AM]
So the fighter can reveal as much or little of this information as he likes

Anders Nelson [11:33 AM]
Should be interesting

Andrew Howard [11:34 AM]
Also, the fighter now gets to choose whether he comes clean with this info and throws in with the party, or if he steals that cryptex and runs off to ally with the antiparty
Or if he pretends to be allied when really he's planning to betray
Or if he just kinda keeps his options open 'til he has more info and/or better situation
Or any other random combination of things he can think of
From chatting with the player, I'm pretty sure he wants to betray the party eventually
We're keeping that a secret, though
Should shock the players pretty well

Anders Nelson [11:35 AM]
haha
and you are basically setting him up for success

Andrew Howard [11:35 AM]
Absolutely
'cause I love that idea

Anders Nelson [11:36 AM]
or at least some story line motives to do so

Andrew Howard [11:36 AM]
Plus, don't forget that the fighter & paladin are very similar builds - hit hard with a greatsword
Also they're half-brothers
Also the fighter's apparently turning evil, while the paladin is LG of course
So there should be some fun rivalry there

Anders Nelson [11:37 AM]
Did the fighter know his dad?
Maybe the LG Pally is the bastard son of the Fighter's Dad

Andrew Howard [11:38 AM]
That could work well actually, 'cause LG pally is also half-elf, and fighter is human

Anders Nelson [11:38 AM]
So dad had a fling with an elf chick

Andrew Howard [11:38 AM]
I asked fighter about his own childhood, and he's under the impression that his dad was pretty much absent
ie: Son of a whore or something

Anders Nelson [11:38 AM]
ah ok

Andrew Howard [11:39 AM]
If dad stuck around, there'd have to be a reason for dad bailing eventually
'cause I kinda want dad to still be around
Pally's self-story is that he's questing to find this Knight he looked up to (ie: Dad, unknowingly)
I try to run with the self-stories as much as possible, rather than just shooting 'em down with "Yeah he's dead"
And now I'm copy/pasting this whole conversation into an email to the Fighter
