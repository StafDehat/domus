Knowledge (geography) check to realize that we're way closer to the South pole than the climate would suggest.

Approaching Braedon, you see smoke.  It appears the town is peppered with many housefires.
Further approaching, you hear the sounds of battle.
Further approaching, no guards at the town walls.  Abominations roam the town.


Introduce the Shattered Star Ioun Stone
Have an idea where the other stones are, 'cause visions & shit

Level-up Nemeses.
-Give 'em another bro, too.  Or Level to X+1.

Figure out who's puppetting Rask.

Lukas was perhaps captured by AntiParty and they grilled him for the Cryptex.
Lukas caught wind of Fatagris and thought that'd be handy.
He's also kind of interested in the Shard of Wrath?
The Mieselmebi let slip a bit of info





What do the Mieselmebi know about Fatagris?
What do they know about Sihedron?
Do they know something Sihedron-related is in the Cryptex?
Why do they want the Cryptex?
  -Maybe they just recognized the runes from some old plaques in their temple.
Lukas is at least intrigued, maybe under duress, who knows.
