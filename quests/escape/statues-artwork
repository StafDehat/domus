I'll give an example of a puzzle I created long ago that worked great. The heroes were trying to get into a vault inside an old abandoned castle. Throughout the castle was artwork, some depicting battles and others depicting heroic feats. Outside the vault room were six statues that would need 2-3 characters to lift them up and put them on their pedestals. Well, the statues were designed after scenes in 3 of the 10 or so paintings that were in the castle. One was a queen knighting her son's squire, one was an owlbear and a fighter engaging in combat and the last was two wizards dueling. If they paid attention, then they would see the answer was there for them. Something as simple as that can leave your players thumping their heads trying to figure it out I mean, in all honesty, player's overthink puzzles all the time. It's rare to have that one player that breaks your puzzle every time. (It has happened to me but he was a good sport and would let the other player's figure it out while he dropped clues.)
