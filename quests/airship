Model: Small wooden frame containing a wired-up piece of SIMPL, sitting on a scale.
 -Gnome places Ring of Jolt in lead box, open/closes box to excite SIMPL.
 -More aura = lighter box, until box starts "falling" upward.

Theory: Large crystal, exposed to a sufficiently-powerful magical aura, could fly a ship.
"Engine" could be a mass of crystal separated by a actuated lead barrier.
 -Withdrawing barrier exposes crystal to aura, increasing the anti-grav.

Small mountains NE of Gnome's house contain caverns, contains a large deposit of SIMPL.
Problem: It's home to a population of giants.
They used to build & live in great towers.
They undertook the Great Work, a massive tower to reach the heavens and meet their god Pazuzu.
Their pride was punished, fire rained from the sky, driving the giants underground.
The god Kostchtchie (KOSH-chuh-chai) offered them sanctuary within the earth, he's the new god now.
Giants know of the SIMPL, but they guard it, because it is Pazuzu's.
They'll guard it to protect themselves frmo Pazuzu's wrath.
Get it.
