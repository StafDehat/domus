Model: Small wooden frame containing a wired-up piece of SIMPL, sitting on a scale.
 -Gnome places Ring of Jolt in lead box, open/closes box to excite SIMPL.
 -More aura = lighter box, until box starts "falling" upward.


Theory: Large crystal, exposed to a sufficiently-powerful magical aura, could fly a ship.
"Engine" could be a mass of crystal separated by a actuated lead barrier.
 -Withdrawing barrier exposes crystal to aura, increasing the anti-grav.

Small mountains NE of Gnome's house contain caverns, home to a race that worships the crystal.
Get it.


Gnome's House:
He's captured Outsiders and is using them to charge the wards in his house.
-Light: For light, obviously.
-Heat: To draw heat out of the house, effectively creating AC.
-Forbiddance: To contain demons.
-Moisture: For his garden.
-Transference: Used to link powered ward to effected ward.
-Breeze: As a fume extractor.
