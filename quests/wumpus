The stones around the cave have been carved with runes.
Keeran is studying them inquisitively.
Paladin yells at him.


DC15 stealth to move through a brimstone space without being noticed.

Managed to get into the cave, then circle back and trap the demons in the cave.
Took turns guarding for awhile, until we were able to etch a wardnet in the stones.

That place is a damn maze.  The ground is treacherous, and there's some unnatural darkness in there.
  It's like walking through a black fog - light still works, just... not so well.
These bookish fellows can't get it through their heads that the place is dangerous.
At least they've sense enough to be afraid, but that doesn't stop them from begging me to go get their precious artifacts.
Apparently seven of them misplaced their life's work while we retreated through the cave.
I'm sure they'd reward you handsomely if you could retrieve it.

Watch yerself walking into the cave - mind you don't marr the wards.
