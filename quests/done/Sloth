Party accused of murdering Windfinder.
Heal/Perception/etc to notice poisoning on Windfinder.
Diplomacize Bikke?

Trepp dragged up from the hold, accused of the murder.
Joline immediately goes along with this.
Trepp insists he's innocent.

Crew returns from island, wounded, with two new peeps, both wounded, one collapses.
  The earth split and belched fire, as if Asmodeus himself touched the world.
  The flames took shape and began attacking.
  No chance to resupply - had to run.
  Survivor is "Gon" - these fire critters aren't a first, but this is a larger force than previously seen.
    Usually a few paladins of Fatagris protect the residents.  This time the force was overwhelming, and they had to retreat.
  The crowd split in panic, the Paladins were trying to gather people to retreat into a cave.
  Some followed, some fled to the boat - Shipmen had to fight 'em back or they'd swamp the boat.

Bikke's pissed.  Would throw 'em in the brig, but there's not enough room for everyone.
Probably try to abandon 'em on the island, with the murdering stuff, keeping their gold too.
Wants to sink Trepp though - if nothing else, he's a stowaway.

Joline blames Party, obviously - they're the newest arrivals.
Joline's carrying assassin guild daggers, and multiple vials of poison.
She also has a faint aura of evil, but is always under undetectable alignment.
Intimidate 25 to get her to run?  Diplomacy to get Bikke against her?

Cast Deflect Blame as necessary to assist with bluffing.
Cast Honeyed Tongue as necessary to assist with Diplomacy.
Vanish? Casts Grease & Spark, then jumps overboard?
Casts Charm Person on Bikke?
Compel Hostility or Compulsive Liar on Trepp?
Innocence to boost Bluff?
Hydrophobia to discourage chasing her.

Save Trepp and he'll talk.
He has an idea where some Shards are located.
