Letter from Knight?
Dakath,
  I've heard tell of a swordsman from a remote town, raised by angels, sworn paladin of Desna.
The stories ring of fancy, and I might dismiss them as rumour, had I not myself seen you growing 
into that very man.
  Wide have I searched for you, my boy.  Alas, you travel quickly and the tales are not always
reliable.  I suspect you may be surprised to hear of the toils attributed to yourself (they say
you rode to the rescue during an attempted assassination of the Duchess, on the back of a griffon
no less!).
  Stories being as they are, and in light of my as-of-yet fruitless search, I am forced to forego
my attempt to reconnect with the lad I once knew well.  The world has need of me, as I am sure it
has need of yourself.  And so, I leave this note with these gifts, in hopes that you one day
return to your childhood home.
  This is the sword I wielded in defense of Sutton, when the Mer-kin invaded from the sea.  As I recall, this story was your favourite.  The sword is known as "Benevolence".  The charm I found during a dark period of my life.  I keep it close as a reminder
of past mistakes, that I may never repeat them.  The stone has always brought me good fortune
and happiness.  It is my hope that it bring the same to you.  
  Safe passage on your travels until our final journey to the heavens.  May we meet again, my friend.
Gareth
