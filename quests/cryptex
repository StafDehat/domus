Somewhere they'll stumble across ancient text:
 -Scrap of parchment?
 -Book in Pungeon, in Aquan (Lao), with sketches & notes of artifacts.
 -Actual symbols are druidic (Greek).
 -Celestial/Terran: "It follows that the weapon secured within the vessel may be used to overcome the greatest plague upon this world."
 -Abyssal: "To attain the power imprisoned beyond is to surpass the greatest of destroyers."

The Cryptex, closed:
It exudes a strong aura of divination.





----- Upon opening, initiate vision: -----
Make a will save (Gauranteed failure)
As [[Character]] slides the two pieces of the cylinder apart, he/she loses consciousness and slumps to the ground.
((( Stop here for the day??? )))
Spellcraft or anything?
Very strong Divination aura on the Character.
Overwhelming transmutation aura on the shard inside the Cryptex.
The Cryptex itself no longer exudes an aura.

See what people do for ~30-60m before going into the vision stuff.

-Mechanics: As "Vision" (https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/v/vision/)

-Witnessing Fatagris arrival.  Quiet mountain town, fireball from sky, investigate & it's Fatagris - he kills you.
  You stand on the back of a plow being pulled through a field by a pair of mules.
  It's a beautiful day, just a hint of chill in the air.
  Though you are facing the sun, you feel a warmth on the back of your neck.
  <Presumably they'll turn to look behind them>
  Behind you, a bright red ball of light streaks through the sky, leaving a thick trail of smoke.
  The ball of light disappears from view as it drops behind the nearest mountain ridge.
  Shortly after, you see a flash of light from the far side of that ridge.
  Suddenly you are struck with a percussive force as you are deafened by a roar and explosion of sonic force.
  You fall unconscious.
  ((( Stop here for the day??? )))
  You regain consciousness - you are lying in what feels and smells like dirt, but you see only white, and hear only a high-pitched whine.
  After a few minutes, the white and whine begin to fade, and your normal vision and hearing return.
  You have a headache, and your hearing is somewhat muted, like there's water in your ears, or you just left a loud concert.
  Your mules are nowhere to be seen, but you can see a lightly-plowed trail taking off in the direction opposite where the ball of light fell.
  Behind the ridge where the ball fell, the sky glows a reddish-orange.
  <<< They investigate, or a friend comes to encourage, or Fatagris just shows up.  Whatev.  Kill 'em. >>>
  A large (10 feet tall), vaguely-humanoid beast rises before you.
    It "stands" upright, as if walking on two legs.
    Where its legs would be however, is a turbulent vortex of fire and rock, as if the creature's waist rested upon a magma-tornado.
    From the waist-up, its skin is tinged a sickly green.
    Six leathery wings spread from its back, three to a side.
    Bony ridges run along the sides of its head and torso, like the ridge along a lizard's spine.
    Its hands and arms are shaped like those of a man, but each finger is tipped in a long, fire-breathing serpent.
    A long gash runs diagonally across its chest, fire dripping from the wound as blood would be dripping similarly on a man.
  The beast notices you looking its direction, and casually gestures in your direction.
  The ground beneath your feet rumbles and shatters, erupting fire from the cracks.
  You see only red, and you hear an unfamiliar scream.
  You are dead before you recognize your own voice.


-Fatagris makes the mountains volcanic, eruption kills you & your town.
  You are 
  Sound: Volcano soundscape

-Cult of Fatagris is burning you on a stake, "purifying the heretics".  Your fellow burnees are shouting that The Warming will kill everyone, the cult insists Fatagris will protect the righteous.
 Sound: Riot Angry mob

-You're an Iceborn too old/weak/infirm to make the trip North, and now you're dying of heat exposure.
  You are lying in bed within a lavishly-decorated room.
  Decorations of crystal and glass in geometric patterns reminiscient of snowflakes adorn the walls and ceiling.
  Many bouquets of blue and white flowers surround you.
  You feel horrible - a throbbing headache, dizzy, nauseaus, weak, and your breathing is shallow.
  Your skin is covered in blisters and has a purplish cast.
  You hold a sheet of paper in your hands, on which is written:
  "The elders/mages/etc believe that if The Warming continue at its present rate, the Northern mountains will remain habitable to our people for another 200 years.
   We have every expectation that your design may be constructed within that time.
   I love you father, and I will miss you.
   Though it pains me that I must leave your side, please take some comfort in knowing that you have saved our people.
   We all owe our lives to you."
  Your aches & pains gradually recede, and you fade from consciousness.

-You are wielding the Sihedron during "Elemental War" to attack Fatagris.
  Sound: 1 hour fantasy battle
  You stand in the mountains in what appears to be a very active volcanic region.
  Battle magic flares all around you.  Waves of water and lava, rays of heat and cold, ice spears and fireballs, glacial walls and walls of flame, fire and ice elementals peppered among the battle.
  Demons soar through the air, breathing fire upon those fighting below.  Vapor lingers in the air behind ice-encrusted weapons as blades pop and sizzle in the bodies of demons.
  You are wearing full plate armor, a heavy metal shield strapped to your left arm, and wielding a brightly-glowing, pure-white longsword in your right.
  About 1 foot directly above you floats a multi-coloured, seven-pointed star.
  Before you is a large cave opening, deeper into this mountain.
  Two beasts appear to be guarding the opening.
    One, an immense amalgum of bear, bull, and serpent, stands on six-legs, is covered with glimmering red scales and wrapped in chains.
    The other, a fanged, three-eyed giant, wears grayish armor.  Where its black and red flesh is exposed, it glows sullenly, reminiscient of a dying campfire, smoldering embers visible under a layer of ash.
  You have the distinct impression that they don't plan on allowing you passage - roll for initiative.

  You: http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/npc-s/npc-20/elicia-stormraven/
  Them: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary2/thrasfyr.html
        http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/bestiary3/oni.html (The Fire one, obviously)
  Sihedron = Plot Armor

  As you enter the cavern, the heat hammers at you, stifling in your armor, but then the 7-pointed star floating above you begins glowing, and you feel comfortable once again.
  You find Fatagris (Typhon) inside the mountain volcano, surrounded by an honour guard of mobs.
  The massive cave is dominated by a lake of magma.
  Amid the lake, like an offshore oil platform is amid an ocean, is an obsidian construct projecting a visible beam veritically into the ceiling of the cavern.
  It looks like the beam has melted the stone itself, forming a vertical shaft through which it projects.
  The stone around the shaft opening is so hot it glows brightly red, and heat distortion radiates from it.
  The monster (Fatagris) speaks in Infernal, ordering his bros to kill you.
  He sends his demons at you, your boys phalanx and split a gap for you, scream at you to take out Fatagris.
  As you approach, Fatagris
  "The world thanks you for your sacrifice."

-You're holding an onyx spike & alabaster hammer, spike positioned over the center of sihedron, on Anvil of Fury.  There are 14 people around you.
  A man with you offers to break it for you, and you can scatter the pieces instead.  Someone swings, sihedron shatters.
  If you, you die.  If friend, you carry 1x shard, 13 people take the other 6x shards and 7x stones.  You are ambushed & killed on your way out.
