Ruins of a castle.

After defeat of Fatagris, an Oracle was consulted, and prophesized that Fatagris would return.
The world would stand against him, and would need advice.
They would meet Xinthos Lanward at Castle Lan, where he would answer their questions.

Paladin (And sons Kaz & Lew) was Lukas' ancestor.
Xinthos is Jondi's ancestor.
Lich = Xinthos (50) + Lew (25) + Elf (100)
Phylactery = Pendant

Brothers Lew & Kaz, sons of the paladin, volunteered for the Lich sacrifice.
 -Lew flipped a trick coin, "won" the right to be sacrified.
 -Kaz went on to father children, and named his son Lew in honour of his brother.  Such was the first Lew, son of Kaz (ie Lew-Kaz) born.

Lukas' ancestor was the Paladin that fought Fatagris, that Jondi embodied in his vision.
Lukas' ancestors were also the two boys who volunteered for Lichdom sacrifice.
Dakath's ancestor was the elf that volunteered for Lichdom sacrifice.
Jondi's ancestor was the Lich, Xinthos Lanward.
