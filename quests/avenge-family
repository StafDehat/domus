Lukas lost wife/daughter (Laura)
Pipa lost family, was sold into circus slavery

Laura's ghost told us of an Orcish Raider/Marauder that attacked their hometown in Rulon.
Laura & Mom ran to contested woods and lived with Halflings in Willowbottom.
Orc found 'em and slaughtered town, sold Pipa.

Orc has missing left eye & big chest scar.  White pants, maybe no penis.

To be learned:
Orc name: 
Orc was hired by Rulon duke to incite anger against Duvia by attacking his own tvillages to justify his war.
