Description
The Shard of Gluttony is made of pale inubrix.
As long as the Shard of Gluttony is carried, its owner can use vampiric touch as a spell-like ability at-will,
  gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus necromancy spells,
  and increases his maximum hit points by 1 point per Hit Die.
At-Will: Vampiric Touch (Sp)

Curse:
On pickup: DC20 Will save vs eat/drink all consumables on person.
You are compelled to indulge.  All things nourishing and/or enjoyable, you want that.  ie: Healing potions, cast healing spells, eat, drink, sex, etc.  This includes spells/abilities that steal life.
When in melee range of a creature, DC15 Will vs Vampiric Touch on them.

Cumulative bonuses:
Successively giving in to gluttonous desires increases the curse & benefits.
Upon killing a creature with Vampiric Touch:
  Creatures killed by your necromantic (Sp) become minions (zombies) under your control.
  You can sense the minion's essence, and its existence makes you stronger.
  DC+2 vs curse
On 10 zombies:
  Passive: Vampiric Shadow Shield
  DC+2 vs curse
On 25 minions:
  Passive: Aura of Cannibalism (DC??)
  DC+2 vs curse
On 50 zombies:
  Vampiric Touch becomes Greater Vampiric Touch
  DC+2 vs curse
On 100 zombies:
  Passive: Healing Thief within Aura of Cannibalism range.
  No more saves - you automatically attack anything in range, stealing its life.

  Gain Craft Skeleton.

If curse ends or cursed is slain, all minions become feral (ie: Zombie Horde)

Curse: The owner is always hungry and thirsty, and is sickened whenever he has not eaten food in the past hour. The owner must make a DC 20 Will save to resist consuming any food or beverage (including potions and the like) he carries immediately. If the save is successful, the owner can resist the urge for 1 hour before being forced to make the save again.
