Description
The Shard of Gluttony is made of pale inubrix. As long as the Shard of Gluttony is carried, its owner can use vampiric touch as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus necromancy spells, and increases his maximum hit points by 1 point per Hit Die.

Curse: The owner is always hungry and thirsty, and is sickened whenever he has not eaten food in the past hour. The owner must make a DC 20 Will save to resist consuming any food or beverage (including potions and the like) he carries immediately. If the save is successful, the owner can resist the urge for 1 hour before being forced to make the save again.
