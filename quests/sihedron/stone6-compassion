Dusty rose prism

Curse:
When used negatively, a nice guy implies a male who is unassertive, 
  does not express his true feelings and, in the context of dating (in which the term is often used[8]), 
  uses acts of ostensible friendship with the unstated aim of progressing to a romantic or sexual relationship
Helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything,
  nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped

Compassion motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical, mental, or emotional pains of another
Compassion also means "Co-suffering", so input = 1/2 damage output?

Will save required to take an offensive action.
  -ie: Run from fights, sure, but not fight back.
DC10 to take the action.
DC15 to avoid taking 1/2 psychic damage yourself.

Boon:
This stone grants the wearer a +1 insight bonus to AC.



Plot:
Dakath's knight father-figure is actually kind of a shitty guy, but was kind to Dakath because he was
  cursed by the Stone of Compassion.
Stone is on a necklace, draped 'round the Empathic Blade, in Dakath's hometown.
