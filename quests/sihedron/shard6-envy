Description
The Shard of Envy is made of shimmering green noqual. As long as the Shard of Envy is carried, its owner can use dispel magic as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus abjuration spells and spell-like abilities, and gains a +1 insight bonus to AC.

Curse: The owner covets the success, wealth, and appearance of all other creatures, and becomes sickened whenever she is within 30 feet of any creature of the same race or character class as herself. Physical contact with such a creature nauseates the owner for 2d6 rounds if she fails a DC 20 Fortitude save.


You want all that.  You also want others to not have stuff.
Periodic Will saves vs Stealing.
