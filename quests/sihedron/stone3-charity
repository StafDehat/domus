Vow of poverty-style.
Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a charitable trust or other worthy cause.
Any time anyone expresses an interest in your time/posessions, you face a Will Save or are compelled to gift that thing.

This stone grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength.


NPC:
Inevitably poor.
Strong wandering man, performing manual labour wherever needed.

Could definitely be a side-quest.  A wife asks the crew to bring her husband home.  He went monk.?
