Letter from Knight?
Dakath,
  I've heard tell of a swordsman from a remote town, raised by angels, sworn paladin of Desna.
Rings of a fancy, and I might dismiss as rumour, had I not seen you growing into the
man in that story myself.  I tried to come meet you, you weren't here, so I'm leaving this stuff
for you:

"Empathic Blade" as above.
Stone of Compassion on necklace.
Your friend,
The Knight
