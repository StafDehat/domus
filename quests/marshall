Skill challenge to earn trust:
 -Go meet him at the barracks.
 -Captain Ahab takes you to the worst area of town.  Really rough.
 -Alignments pretty much won't allow people to murder.


He binds your wrists & ankles with rope, then dumps 500 gold onto the ground, slowly, and asks you to deliver it all to him at the barracks.  He hops onto his horse & rides.
 -Bright yellow sack contains the coins
 -Pickpockets all-round.
 -Archers on the rooftops.
 -Footpads ambushing.
 -Traps.
 -A woman crying for help (It's bogus)

 -Barricades built up to force travel
 -They send dogs after you.  Tracking?  You hear barking.
