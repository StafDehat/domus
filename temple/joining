Areas of the church are off-limits to non-members.
To join, you must be bonded

Joining/Bonding:
A red-robed cleric walks in, carrying a stack of stained white rags in his hands.
He sets down the rags, opens a box hanging 'round his neck, takes out a smoldering green briquet.
 -Holds it in his hand, though it looks like it should burn him.
 -Lifts it to an unlit torch, and the torch smokes, then bursts into a greenish/yellow flame.
Another cleric draws a ceremonial knife, cuts your hand (in a six-point pattern).
Uses a clean white cloth to stanch your bleeding.
Takes both cloths and wraps them around a small block of incense.
Ties 'em up using a bit of twine?
Hangs it over a metal pole/hook thing, and holds it into a green-flame torch.
It flares and is quickly consumed.
You feel a wave of warmth, like you're sitting in front of a tavern fire - far more heat than should have been released from that little burst.
"Hold out your hand"
They hold a red torch to your hand.  It doesn't hurt.
Fatagris protects you, child.


Members-only Service:
6x clerics each carry a single hellstone
They stand around a carved summoning circle, molten silver having been poured into the grooves.
A 7th cleric walks into the room and places a tiny organ in the center of the circle.
Each cleric places their hellstone in the ring.
They begin chanting, and heat distortion forms in the center
A green light begins radiating out from the circle.
There's a flash that's too bright - you shield your eyes.
When you look back, there's an imp inside the circle.
It sniffs a couple times, then looks down at the organ, snatches it up and eats it.
While it's distracted by the heart, the 7th cleric takes a polearm and knicks the imp.
The cleric takes a white rag off a stack and uses it to clean the polearm blade of the imp's brownish blood.
The rag is placed on a shelf next to the clean-rag stack.
This whole process is repeated a few times, then Cleric7 takes the stack of dirty rags out of the room.
