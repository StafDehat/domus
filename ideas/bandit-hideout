The DM had us infiltrating an extremely exclusive hotel that had a criminal organization on one of the floors- hiding in plain sight. For some reason (I forget, it's been a while) each floor could only be accessed by individuals with colored rings. Each floor had a different color ring that allowed you entrance. The rogue did not make any of his checks in his attempts to steal a yellow ring for the first floor and got identified by the guards who kicked him out and sent his description to every other floor.
