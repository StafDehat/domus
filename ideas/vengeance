Turns out Lukas's dead daughter is real, and the ghost has actually been following him around this whole time, and now everyone can see her.
She spent a few weeks in Willowbottom, then Half-orc warlord murdered daughter & Pipa's parents.
Lukas & Pip want vengeance now.


10 years ago there was a minor war between Duvia & Rulon over that contested territory.

There's a ~6-year old human girl hiding "behind" a desk in the corner of this room, but not obscured very well because, well, ethereal.
Lukas is carrying some keepsake from his daughter, and that's what she's bound to.
Pipa notices the girl is wearing a brooch as a cloak-clasp, and it looks very similar to one that Pipa has always had.
 -Why?  Daughter fled to Pipa's hometown, before Daughter killed & Pipa enslaved.
Turns out that while Lukas was away fighting in Rulon's campaign against Duvia, BANDITS raided Lukas' hometown, taking advantage of the fighting men's absense.
Lukas' wife was almost raped & murdered by BigBanditGuy in view of the daughter, but was able to wound & fight off her attacker, though sustained injuries herself in the process.
Lukas' wife & daughter ran off and found shelter in a halfling village named Willowbottom.  Wife died of her wounds shortly after.
BigBanditGuy was pissed at wife so chased 'em, tracked to Willowbottom, was angry that she'd died before he had a chance to kill her.
BigBanditGuy killed most of the village, save a few of the children (including Pipa (10)), and sold 'em to slavers.
Lukas partially blames conscription for his loss, mostly BigBanditGuy.
Lukas deserted & has been wandering since.
Pipa was sold as a slave to a traveling "circus" in Rulon, escaped 8 years later and has been hiding out in Duvia since.

Pipa's ~20 now, Lukas is ~35.
