Clerics cultivate a flower, hydroponically, using holy water.
The seeds of this flower, when burned, allow the goddess Irori to answer a question.
The seed will either smoke and fizzle out, indicating a negative or unfavourable response, or the seed will flash brightly to indicate a positive, favourable response.
