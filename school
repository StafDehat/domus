Income is based on students & level-up cost.

How long does it take?

Headmaster
Wage: 3 gp/day
Skills: Diplomacy, Knowledge (any two), Profession (any one)
A Headmaster manages a place of learning, such as a Bardic College, Magical Academy, or University. Sheâ€™s typically a 3rd-level alchemist, bard, expert, rogue, sorcerer, wizard, or witch. Running an establishment of higher learning includes basic administration, educating students, and ongoing research.


Research the deets for a player-character undergoing training:

Jondi's employees:
 Let him pick from all CR1/CR2 NPCs, but just give him the names, not the stats.
 They make a profession skill-check as if they were PCs earning wages during downtime.  

Jondi's profits:
 For each student, they need to do the actual, correct, formal "Training" to get XP, then "Leveling up" process.
 Whatever that time/cost is, that's Jondi's income rate.

Jondi's expenses:
 To make CL1 Necros, he needs to buy spell components to teach enough spells for an SL1 Necro.
 To make CLX (SL2) Necros, he needs to buy all SL1 Necro spell components once, and some SL2 components
 He must expand the building as necessary to accomodate all the students/teachers.

Jondi's unexpected expenses:
 Natural disasters?
 Spell mishaps (1/week/student)
