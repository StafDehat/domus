Think of a value
Date, Duvia seal, someone's signature, maybe some wax something

3d print a Duvia Seal

Income is based on students & level-up cost.
How far can Necros level-up in his school?
How long does it take?



Magical Academy

  121 Goods, (comp'd - you have a house)
  17 Influence, 
  110 Labor, (Reduce this, more if he gets Willenbrock to teach)
  5 Magic
  Total: (5,630 gp)
He has:
  121/121 Goods (ie: The house)
  10/17 Influence (House is reputed to be haunted already)
  60/110 Labour, from necros at the school.  They want up-front pay, though.

Headmaster
Wage: 3 gp/day
Skills: Diplomacy, Knowledge (any two), Profession (any one)
A Headmaster manages a place of learning, such as a Bardic College, Magical Academy, or University. She’s typically a 3rd-level alchemist, bard, expert, rogue, sorcerer, wizard, or witch. Running an establishment of higher learning includes basic administration, educating students, and ongoing research.


Research the deets for a player-character undergoing training:

Jondi's employees:
 Let him pick from all CR1/CR2 NPCs, but just give him the names, not the stats.
 They make a profession skill-check as if they were PCs earning wages during downtime.  

Jondi's profits:
 For each student, they need to do the actual, correct, formal "Training" to get XP, then "Leveling up" process.
 Whatever that time/cost is, that's Jondi's income rate.

Jondi's expenses:
 To make CL1 Necros, he needs to buy spell components to teach enough spells for an SL1 Necro.
 To make CLX (SL2) Necros, he needs to buy all SL1 Necro spell components once, and some SL2 components
 He must expand the building as necessary to accomodate all the students/teachers.

Jondi's unexpected expenses:
 Natural disasters?
 Spell mishaps (1/week/student)
